# LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode journey! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems that I've solved. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress and improve my problem-solving skills. Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation and examples to help you understand the approach.

## Problem-Solving Approach

I try to solve problems using efficient algorithms and data structures. For each problem, I attempt to:

1. **Understand the problem statement** and constraints.
2. **Devise a strategy** to solve the problem, often breaking it down into smaller steps.
3. **Write clean and optimized code** to solve the problem.
4. **Test the solution** with sample inputs and edge cases.
5. **Document the solution** with explanations and examples for better understanding.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files for each problem:

1. **Solution.java**: The main solution file containing the code to solve the problem.
2. **FullCode.java**: This file includes the solution code along with a `main` function for dynamic input and testing.
3. **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the problem, the solution approach, and example inputs/outputs.

## How to Run the Code

1. Navigate to the directory containing the problem you want to solve:

   ```bash
   cd LeetCode-Journey
2. Open the solution file (e.g., FullCode.java) in your favorite IDE or text editor.

3. Compile and run the solution using the following commands:

    ```bash
    javac FullCode.java
    java FullCode
